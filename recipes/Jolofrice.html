    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="p-descrip">Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or <strong>jollof rice</strong>, is a rice dish from West Africa.
         The dish is typically made with long-grain 
        rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or
         meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation
          methods vary across different regions. The dish's origins
           are traced to Senegal.[3] </p>
    <p class="p-descrip">Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. 
        There are several regional variations in name and ingredients;[1] 
        for example, in Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan. The dish's 
        most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people,[10] 
        though in <em>Senegal</em>, Mauritania and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as
         ceebu jën or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. 
         Despite the variations, the dish is <em>"mutually intelligible"></em> across the regions 
         and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.[2][11][12][13][14]
          It is found throughout the world wherever 
        communities of West African immigrants have developed.[11]</p>

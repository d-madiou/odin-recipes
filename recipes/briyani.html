    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><strong>Biryani</strong> is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora,
         although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.</p>
    <p>According to historian <strong>Lizzie Collingham</strong> , the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of
         the Mughal Empire <strong><em>(1526–1857) </em></strong>and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian 
         polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris 
        Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.</p>

In this project, I'm going to create my first index.html.

I have learned many things through this first project:

    First, how to associate three HTML pages into one using the "href" attribute.
    Secondly, I have learned how to access an image from Google or any other source by using the image link.
    Finally, I have learned a lot about formatting text, making it bold or italic, resizing pictures, and so on.
